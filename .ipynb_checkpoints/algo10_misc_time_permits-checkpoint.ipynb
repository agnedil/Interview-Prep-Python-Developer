    "** You've been given a list of historical stock prices for a single day for Amazon stock. The index of the list represents the timestamp, so the element at index of 0 is the initial price of the stock, the element at index 1 is the next recorded price of the stock for that day, etc. Your task is to write a function that will return the maximum profit possible from the purchase and sale of a single share of Amazon stock on that day. Keep in mind to try to make this as efficient as possible.**\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "For example, if you were given the list of stock prices:\n",
    "\n",
    "prices = [12,11,15,3,10]\n",

    "Let's think about a few things before we start coding. One thing to think about right off the bat is that we can't just find the maximum price and the lowest price and then subtract the two, because the max could come before the min.\n",
    "\n",
    "The brute force method would be to try every possible pair of price combinations, but this would be O(N^2), pretty bad. Also since this is an interview setting you should probably already know that there is a smarter solution.\n",

    "In this case we will use a [greedy algorithm](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Greedy_algorithm) approach. We will iterate through the list of stock prices while keeping track of our maximum profit.\n",

If it’s less, then we continue our search between N/4 and N/2. Otherwise if it’s greater, then we search between 0 and N/4. In both cases we reduce the potential range by half and continue, this is the logic of binary search. We’re not performing regular binary search though, it’s modified.

    "This solution exploits the property that if we take the exponent of the log of a number, the result  doesn’t change, it’s still the number itself. So we can first calculate the log of a number, multiply with 0.5, take the exponent, and finally take the floor of that value to round it down. This way we can avoid using the sqrt function by using the log function. Logarithm of a number rounded down to the nearest integer can be calculated in constant time, by looking at the position of the leftmost 1 in the binary representation of the number. For example, the number 6 in binary is 110, and the leftmost 1 is at position 2 (starting from right counting from 0). So the logarithm of 6 rounded down is 2. This solution doesn’t always give the same result as above algorithms though, because of the rounding effects. And depending on the interviewer’s perspective this approach can be regarded as either very elegant and clever, or tricky and invalid. Either way, you should let your interviewer know that you are capable of the shortcut!"

The root can take any value between negative infinity and positive infinity. At any node, its left child should be smaller than or equal than its own value, and similarly the right child should be larger than or equal to. So during recursion, we send the current value as the new max to our left child and send the min as it is without changing. And to the right child, we send the current value as the new min and send the max without changing. "
