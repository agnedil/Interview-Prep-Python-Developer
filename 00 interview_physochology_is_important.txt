Here are the articles I was chatting about and some other areas/items I feel is important in first interviews. 
 

First impressions:  these are important.  Try to make the first 30 seconds about showing warmth and having connection.  Good eye contact.

 

Intentions for the Interview:  I believe it is important to have one or two simple intentions for the Interview.  Here is what I would set as intentions (but, please do what works for you):

 

1.  It is my intention to show my warmth and truly connect with the interviewer(s).

2.  It is my intention to show my competence and fit for this job.

 

Here is why I believe these are two good intentions to have for the interview:

 

"Trustworthiness is the fundamental trait that people - not just interviewers - automatically and unconsciously look for in others.  There are two qualities you need to possess to be seen as trustworthy:  warmth and competence."

 

Please read these articles for studies that back this up.

"If you focus on how the communication works, and a candidate checks out with others on a technical level, then a strong yes from you is a yes, and anything less is a no. Great candidates are the ones who, after 15 minutes, you can't imagine not hiring."
