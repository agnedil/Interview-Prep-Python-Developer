    "__Instructions__  \n",
    "Your task is to implement a simple cloud storage system. All operations that should be supported are listed below.\n",
    "\n",
    "Solving this task consists of several levels. Subsequent levels are opened when the current level is correctly solved. You always have access to the data for the current and all previous levels.\n",
    "\n",
    "Requirements\n",
    "Your task is to implement a simple cloud storage system that maps objects (files) to their metainformation. Specifically, the storage system should maintain files along with some information about them (name, size, etc.). Note that this system should be in-memory, you do not need to work with the real filesystem.\n",
    "\n",
    "Plan your design according to the level specifications below:\n",
    "\n",
    "* Level 1: The cloud storage system should support adding new files, retrieving, and copying files.\n",
    "* Level 2: The cloud storage system should support finding files by matching prefixes and suffixes.\n",
    "* Level 3: The cloud storage system should support adding users with various capacity limits.\n",
    "* Level 4: The cloud storage system should support compressing and decompressing files.\n",
    "To move to the next level, you need to pass all the tests at this level.\n",
    "\n",
    "Note\n",
    "\n",
    "You will receive a list of queries to the system, and the final output should be an array of strings representing the returned values of all queries. Each query will only call one operation.\n",
    "\n",
    "It is guaranteed that the given queries will never call operations that result in collisions between file and directory names."
