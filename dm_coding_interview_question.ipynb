    "# There is a self-driving car in the middle lane at the beginning of a 3-lane, 1000 unit long highway. Along the road, there are some obstacles (marked \"O\") and refueling stops (marked \"F\"). If the car overlaps an obstacle, it crashes and cannot continue. If it chooses to use a refueling stop, it adds 50 units of fuel (the car has a tank capable of holding 100 units of fuel, and it starts with 50 units).\n",
    "# The car has a very limited memory. It can accept a string of 10 characters, which can be D, R, L, or F. The letter D instructs the car to drive forward 1 unit, the letters R or L will shift the car to the right or left without moving forward. All these consume 1 unit of fuel. The letter F causes the car to attempt to refuel, this only succeeds if it is currently on a refueling stop. This does not consume any fuel. The car continuously loops over this string of 10 commands, until it reaches the end, crashes, or runs out of fuel.\n",
